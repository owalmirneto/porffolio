# [walmir.dev](https://walmir.dev) by [@owalmirneto](https://github.com/owalmirneto)

This is a project that promotes Walmir Neto, AKA (Also Known As) ME. Here I must use technologies that I used in my career and technologies that I want to learn.

The initial plan is to have an API-only [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org) application served with [GraphQL](https://graphql-ruby.org), a web version using [NextJS 13](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-13) and a mobile version using [Flutter](https://flutter.dev).

Furthermore, I intend to automate the deployment of all applications using [Terraform](https://terraform.io), [Ansible](https://ansible.com) on [Github Actions](https://docs.github.com/actions), using [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com) for backend, vercel for frontend and hopefully an app on [Google Play](https://play.google.com) and [App Store](https://apple.com/app-store)

## Apps documentations

 * [Backend](./apps/backend)
 * [Frontend](./apps/frontend)
 * Mobile (Soon)
 * [Terraform](./apps/terraform)
 * Ansible (Soon)
